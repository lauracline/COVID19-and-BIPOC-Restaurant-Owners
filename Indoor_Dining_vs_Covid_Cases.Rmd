abstract: "This paper uses multiple linear regression and multiple logistic regression to explore the relationship between opening Ontario restaurants for in-door dining and the number of COVID-19 cases traced back to that restaurant in March 2021. We used simple random sampling on 38,000 Ontario restaurants in the Canadian Business Registries to pull a sample of ~18,900 restaurants who were split into treatment and control groups. The paper exposes that restaurants who received the treatment - open for indoor dining - had significantly more COVID-19 cases traced back to their location compared to restaurants who did not receive the treatment. Therefore, the paper concludes that the Ontario restaurants should keep restaurants shutdown for indoor dining in order to minimize the spread of the virus and protects Ontarians health."
