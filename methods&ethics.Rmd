# Population, Frame, and Sample:

The population in question for this survey is all restaurants in Ontario, and our sampling frame are Ontario restaurants registered under the Canadian Business Registries. From this, our final survey sample will be Ontario restaurant owners who respond to an electronic questionnaire sent via. email. As an incentive, we will inform survey candidates that their responses will help shape policies being put in place by the Ontario Provincial government geared towards relieving the economic impact restaurants face during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

# Sampling methods

As a means of mitigating bias in our survey, our sampling methodology is somewhat twofold, with the first sample attempting to mitigate the biases introduced in the 'second.' Furthermore, we cannot use cluster or stratified sampling because we are unable to determine whether a restaurant belongs to a particular strata or cluster because this data is not available in Canada's Business Registries. Instead, we are using a *simple random sample without replacement* (SRSWOR) whereby the sample is randomly selected from a subset of the population. Practically, this means each sample observation is individually selected with an equal probability of being drawn. The practical sampling procedure utilized to draw a sample from our population comes from the tidyverse package in the r statistical programming language. 

In this sampling method, each member of the population has an exactly equal chance of being selected for the survey. This is the optimal sampling method for this survey because it involves a single random selection and requires little knowledge in advance about the demographics of the population. This method also has high internal validity because it reduces the impact of potential confounding variables. With a large enough sample size, a simple random sample also has high external validity because it will represent all the characteristics of the larger population. The sampling design we utilized comes from Wu and Thompson (2020) and will assume population values are fixed, which they will be at the time the sample is drawn from the Canadian Business Registries. It is also assumed that our SRSWOR satisfies the following probability measure:

![Where P(**S**) is the sampling method, N/n is the total size of survey candidates of population N ](Projects/Paper2_starting_repo/inputs/Stats_figures/probability_measure.png)

As previously noted, given a large enough sample size, estimators such as the sample mean (average) and sample variance ('spread-outedness' of the data) can aid us in making inferences about our population as a whole, the sample mean and sample variance can be written as:

![where *i* is units sampled and **S** is the sample](Paper2_starting_repo/inputs/Stats_figures/sample_mean_std.png)
Given the above statistical expressions that define the sample mean and probability measure, estimating our population mean through SRSWOR can be achieved as follows when yhat(**S**) and P(**S**) are expanded into their whole expressions and subsequently manipulated in the following proof from Wu and Thompson:

![Proof the sample mean is a sufficient estimator of the population mean](Paper2_starting_repo/inputs/Stats_figures/SRSWOR_proof.png)

For our purposes, this proof gives us sufficient reason to believe the simple random sampling method we want to use is in fact random and will tell us information that is relevant to the population itself. 

While not necessarily a second stage, since we are relying on data gathering techniques that require voluntary response to survey sent via. email, it is still important to note the biases such a selection process can bring with it. In a word, while a simple random sample was introduced to reduce bias, self reporting may reintroduce it to a lesser degree. This could be potentially compounded by the offered incentive, which may provide a larger pool of businesses that have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic than those who have not. While this is a minor consideration given the emphasis placed on conducting a SRSWOR if a sufficient size in our initial sampling phase, it is still worth noting as a possible bias in the data.

# Ethical considerations of this data

In addition to potential biases this data may be subject to, the ethical considerations of our sample data must also be considered carefully as we are dealing with information about a struggling Ontario business community as well as asking questions geared specifically towards racialized groups in Canada. Because of this, our sample data has a unique set of considerations that lie at the intersection of data privacy, equity, and access. First, and in all cases, to protect the individual privacy of respondents, all surveys are anonymous and neither business nor owner names are recorded. In addition, location data will not be collected with enough specificity to identify survey respondents. 

In terms of handling the ethical concerns related to our survey data, danah boyd, Solon Barocas, Kate Crawford, and number of other scholars provide guidance in their article "10 Simple Rules for Responsible Big Data Research" (2017). The 10 rules can be understood as follows:

1. Acknowledge that data are people and can do harm
2. Recognize that privacy is more than a binary value
3. Guard against the reidentification of your data
4. Practice ethical data sharing
5. Consider the strengths and limitations of your data; big does not              automatically mean better
6. Debate the tough, ethical choices
7. Develop a code of conduct for your organization, research community, or        industry
8. Design your data and systems for auditability
9. Engage with the broader consequences of data and analysis practices
10.Know when to break these rules

In essence, our sampling strategy, as well as the approach we take in this entire survey design, reflects these 10 rules robustly. First, privacy will be protected through ensuring the survey questions are not designed to collect personally identifiable information (PII), and that no questions regarding location have too much specificity. For example, our survey will gather data on the municipality or region of the restaurant as well as whether the restaurant is rural or urban - but will not be recording addresses or postal codes. Data for this survey will be collected via. Google Forms, a commonly used and secure survey platform that allows researchers to collect survey data electronically with ease. 

In terms of ethically sharing our data, the entirety of this survey design will be made publicly available via. Github repository as a means of ensuring our work is reproducible as well as methodologically robust. Utilizing a version control tool such as Github also has the advantage of giving our work (read, the associated systems and data) for increased auditability and transparency, a crucial component of any ethical data work. 

In terms of the "tough ethical choices" our team debated while designing this survey, there are two I would like to discuss. For a large majority of this survey design, we were unsure how to proceed with classifying racialized groups in Canada, and wavered back and forth on using the term BIPOC (black, indigenous person of colour) in the survey itself. While one of our initial objectives was to understand the impact COVID restrictions had on BIPOC restaurants, we ran into the issue of the term BIPOC being not readily defined. This was also compounded with the fact that the term BIPOC may be unfamiliar some some of our survey respondents, and why we opted to use language of "racialized" groups instead. This certainly will have an impact on the data our survey will be collecting as the inclusion of other racialized groups in our treatment group means the scope is no longer contained to BIPOC businesses. Regardless, our original intent of exploring the impact of COVID restrictions from a perspective of equity and advocacy for racialized groups in Canada, who in countless other contexts have been affected by the pandemic the most (get citations.

The second "tough ethical choice" our team had to make surrounded whether we would try to capture or account for businesses not operating with a business license. While the notorious Adamson BBQ was the first of these types of businesses to come to our minds, upon more discussion we realized there may be a significant chunk of businesses currently operating without licenses in Ontario that may be doing so due issues of systemic inequality and lack of access to business resources. While we discussed that this would most certainly be data that is crucial to collect on a oft overlooked population, the fact that our sampling frame is restaurants registered in the Ontario Business Registy means we limited our capacity to study this population from the outset. Having said that we understand our inferences can only be made about a (registered) subset of Ontario's entire restaurant population, which also includes ones that are unregistered.
